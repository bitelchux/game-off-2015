Octocoder
=========

Octocoder is a tetris-like game where you have to collect code blocks and deploy them into 
applications. Combine the blocks to build popular applications and earn lots of points.
It was born as a fork of [Octocat Jump](https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012)
and is my entry for the [Github Game Off 2015](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed).

[Play it!](http://satanas.github.io/game-off-2015/)

Rules
=====
1. Take the code blocks and combine them horizontally to create an application.

2. Missed blocks will become bugs

3. Unknown or buggy applications won't be deployed.

4. Each successful deploy will give you points and the blocks of that line will dissapear.

5. If Octocat touch the top of the screen, you lose.

6. If you create an app with more than 4 bugs (40%), you lose.

Some combinations could be Python + HTML to create Django applications or Ruby + HTML to create Ruby on Rails apps. 
Try yourself other combinations to discover all the possibilities.

Controls
========

* ← and → to move the player
* ↓ to drop the block
* P to pause the game
* M to mute the music

I want to thank Thiago Costa for his help and his ideas for the mechanic of the game :)
