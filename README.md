Octocoder
=========

Octocoder is a tetris-like game where you have to collect code blocks and deploy them into 
applications. Combine the blocks to build popular applications and earn lots of points.
It was born as a fork of [Octocat Jump](https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012)
and is my entry for the [Github Game Off 2015](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed).

Thanks

I want to thank Thiago Costa for his help and his ideas for the mechanic of the game :)
